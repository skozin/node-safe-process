Helper for initializing and deinitializing an Node.js application.

Documentation and examples are currently pending, sorry. But the API is very simple,
it's just one function that takes one options objext, so you can take a look at the
source to see how to use this.

### Caveats

This module is written in ES6 and uses JS modules, so you'll need to use some kind 
of transpiler, e.g. Babel, and teach it to not ignore this module.

Later this module will include transpiled code, in addition to ES6 sources.
